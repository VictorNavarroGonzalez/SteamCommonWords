# Steam Common Words
Minimalist web app that allows you to search the most common words used in the reviews of your favorite Steam games.

## What I learned
I build this app with the intetion of improving my portfolio and skillset. On the process of building it, I learned:
- How to create a web applications with Flask
- Basic deployment using Google App Engine
- JQuery and some web experience (which I lacked)
- Improve further my understanding of Python

## How it works
Search your favorite games on the search bar and let the auto-prediction help you.

After a few seconds of selecting your game, the app will show you the most common words currently used in the reviews.
Their opacity will tell you their popularity.
